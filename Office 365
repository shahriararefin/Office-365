Office 365

This method was shared by Massgravel, and I've made a PowerShell script to automate it for you.

• If you already have Office installed, uninstall it first. Afterwards, use this OfficeScrubber to clean any traces. Choose [1] or [R], as you please.

• Restart your computer before the next process.

• Run this code in PowerShell:
Code:

irm https://naeembolchhi.github.io/Get-Office-365/GO365.ps1  | iex

This will automatically install Office 365 on your computer. Duration depends on Internet speed.

• Now run this code in PowerShell:
Code:

irm https://get.activated.win  | iex

• Select [2] to activate Office. And you're done.
